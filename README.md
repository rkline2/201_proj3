# Scoring Go

## 1. Task
You will be programming up a simplified scoring system for the board game Go. Go is an abstract strategy
game where two players compete to surround as much of a board with their colored pieces as possible.
At the end of the game, each players score is the sum of how many pieces they still have on the board
with how much empty space their pieces surround.

Your program will need to:
  * Read in and store a completed Go game board from a file
  * Mark all of the empty spaces on the board with the symbol of the player's piece that controls them
  * Sum the total scores and display them to the user.

## 2. Objective
Project 3 is designed to give you practice with two-dimensional lists, creating and calling functions, and recursion.
You’ll need to use practically everything you’ve learned so far, and will need to do some serious thinking about how all 
of the pieces you need to create should fit together.
